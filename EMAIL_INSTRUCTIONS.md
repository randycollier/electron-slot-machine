Subject: Slot Machine Game - Code Submission

Hi [Recipient Name],

I've attached my slot machine game implementation. The file is renamed as .txt to bypass email filters.

To use it:

1. Download the attachment: webai-challenge-submission.txt

2. Rename it back to .zip:
   - macOS/Linux: mv webai-challenge-submission.txt webai-challenge-submission.zip
   - Windows: Rename the file extension from .txt to .zip

3. Extract and run:
   unzip webai-challenge-submission.zip
   cd webai-challenge
   npm install
   npm run dev

The package includes:
âœ… Complete source code (TypeScript + React + Electron)
âœ… SQLite database with sample game data
âœ… Working leaderboard with 3 sample players
âœ… Full documentation

File size: 247 KB (compressed)
Uncompressed: ~15 MB

Sample database includes players "Randy" (180 credits) and "r" (115 credits) so you can see the leaderboard working immediately.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
